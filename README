Titanium Android Module: FusedLocation for Android
==================================================
This is a Titanium Android module to take advantage of FusedLocation. Location Updates faster, and much better on battery drainage.


Important to Note when used with other Android Modules like (ti.map)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are using FusedLocation with ti.map. Make sure to delete in ca.underlabs.fusedlocation/1.2.1/lib/ these 2 jars: 
- classes-base.jar and 
- classes-basement.jar 
since theyâ€™re already in ti.map, and just leave classes.jar (which has com.google.android.gms.location)

When Compiling the Module, you'll need all three in your build path.

Default Geolocation Updates:
----------------------------
By Default in the code (hardcoded - pull requests welcomed):
- PRIORITY is set to 100 (meaning GPS - Most Accurate)
- DISTANCE_FILTER is set to 5 meters (location event updates when accelerometers senses that 5 meters have been traversed)

If Distance Filter is triggered (example driving very fast), below are handled by:
- FASTEST_UPDATE_FREQ is set to 1 second (every 1 sec at fastest)
- INTERVAL is set to 5 second (at latest)

TODO: These are Hardcoded - PullRequests are Welcomed, and I will try to update it so that these can be passed from Ti App part of `startGeoLocation`.

Usage:
------

Register your module with your application by editing `tiapp.xml` and adding your module.

<modules>
	<module version="1.2.2">ca.underlabs.fusedlocation</module>
</modules>

To use the module in code, you will need to require it.
`
	var FusedLocation = require('ca.underlabs.fusedlocation');
	
	GoogleApiClient.startGeoLocation({
		success: function(e) {
			// returns similar to iOS location event: 
			// {"type":"location","success":true,"provider":"fused",
			//		"coords":{"bearing":0,"latitude":40.4688283,"timestamp":1486002223000,"speed":0,"accuracy":1,"longitude":-72.74637}}
			Ti.API.info(JSON.stringify(e)); 
		},
		error: function(e) {
			Ti.API.info('Android GeoLocation Fusion Error :(');
			$.label.text = 'Nay';
			Ti.API.info(JSON.stringify(e));
		}
	});
	
	GoogleApiClient.stopGeoLocation(); // Don't forget to stop it when not needed.
